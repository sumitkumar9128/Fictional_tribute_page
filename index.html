      <h2>About Gojo</h2>
      <p>Gojo Satoru, a name whispered with awe and trepidation throughout the Jujutsu world. A prodigy born into power, his white hair and signature blindfold mark him as one destined for greatness.</p>
      <p>His mastery of the Six Eyes and Infinity grants him near-invincibility, while his unconventional methods and playful demeanor challenge the rigid traditions of the Jujutsu society.</p>
      <p>Gojo Satoru is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Clan, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.</p>

        <h3>The Unbound Soul</h3>
        <p>Despite his immense power, Gojo's personality is anything but ordinary. A playful and sometimes arrogant demeanor masks a sharp intellect and unwavering conviction in his own ideals. He challenges tradition and authority, believing in nurturing young sorcerers rather than clinging to outdated practices.

          His unorthodox methods and carefree attitude often clash with the Jujutsu establishment, but his loyalty to his students and unwavering commitment to protecting humanity are undeniable.</p>
